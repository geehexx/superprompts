# Markdown Documentation Standards

## Rule
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use consistent code block formatting with language specification
- Include proper alt text for images
- Use consistent list formatting (numbered vs bulleted)
- Include proper link formatting with descriptive text
- Use blockquotes for important notes and warnings
- Include frontmatter for metadata when appropriate
- Use consistent line length (80-100 characters)
- Include proper file naming conventions (kebab-case)

## Examples
```markdown
# SuperPrompts MCP Server

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API Reference](#api-reference)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install with uv
uv add superprompts

# Or install with pip
pip install superprompts
```

## Usage

> **Note**: This is an important note about usage.

### Basic Example
```python

    server = MCPServer()
    await server.start()

```

## Rationale
Consistent Markdown formatting improves readability, maintainability, and automated processing of documentation.
